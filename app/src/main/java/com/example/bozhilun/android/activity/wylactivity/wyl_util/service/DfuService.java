     * is a root activity (that means no other activity was open earlier) or that some
     * other activity is already open. In the latter case the NotificationActivity will just be
     * closed. The system will restore the previous activity. However, if the application has been
     * closed during upload and you click the notification, a NotificationActivity will
     * be launched as a root activity. It will create and start the main activity and
     * terminate itself.
     *
     * This method may be used to restore the target activity in case the application
     * was closed or is open. It may also be used to recreate an activity history using
     * startActivities(...).
